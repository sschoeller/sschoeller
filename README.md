I previously completed my undergraduate degree in Chemistry, where I was involved in a team project related to protein biochemistry. A large portion of the assigned tasks were related to data analysis. I also earned a Knuth Reward Check in 2019 for a "significant suggestion" (0x$0.20) as well as a check for three errors in 2020 and a check for an additional error in 2021 (for a total of 0x$4.20). Additonally, I completed a master's degree in Computer Science. <br />
<br />
Tech-related Hobbies: I enjoy working with UNIX-like operating systems. <a href="https://devuan.org/">Devuan</a> and <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> are my current favorites. In recent years, I became interested in two-factor and multi-factor authentication. I have since methodically locked down my logins using FIDO, smart card authentication and TOTP.

Additional Interests: Quantum Mechanics, Playing Piano, Writing, History
